    <p class="primary-content">The non-profit is launching a program called "Universal Healthy Care", that is designed to provide well balanced meals for children during after school hours. Due to socioeconomic status both parents in our nation are forced to work, and also there are numerous children who are reared in single parent households which sometimes prevent these children from receiving well balanced meals other than what they receive in schools.
  Cheerity4All plan to reach these children by working with various community centers in our metro, and from these institutions is where our children will have access to healthy meals.
