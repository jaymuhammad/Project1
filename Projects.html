<h3 class="primary-content">The non-profit is launching a program called Universal Healthy Care, that is designed to provide well balanced meals for children during after school hours due to the fact that we live in a society now where both parents are forced to work and that there are numerous of children who are reared in single parent households which sometimes prevent these children from receiving well balanced meals other than what they receive in school.
Cheerity4All plan to reach these children by working with various community centers, which every community virtually has, and from these community centers is where the children will have access to these meals. Due to immigration, the City of Louisville has grown from being a predominately Caucasian and African-American city to a substantially diverse place possessing significant populations of Latino, African, Chinese, Korean, Middle-Eastern, Bosnian, and Russian or Eastern European cultures to name a few.
