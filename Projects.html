   <h2>Universal Healthy Care</h2> 
  <p class="primary-content">The non-profit is launching a program called "Universal Healthy Care", that is designed to provide well balanced meals for children during after school hours. Due to socioeconomic status most parents in our nation are forced to work, and also there are numerous children who are reared in single parent households and with that single-parent working various hours. This sometimes prevent these children from receiving well balanced meals other than what they receive in schools.
  Cheerity4All plan's to reach these children by working with various community centers in our metro, and from these institutions is where our children will have access to healthy meals.</p>
  <h2>Sackcloth</h2> 
  <p class="primary-content">The organization will also be jumpstarting our "Sackcloth" program that will supply qualified School children with uniforms and some school supplies that we hope will remove that worry from parents and children so that our students can focus on academics and and acheiving greatness.
